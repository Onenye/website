//FIVE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF REACT

a). React is SEO-friendly.
b). Helps to create awesome UI.
c). It can be used with other frame works.
d). It simplifies the complete process of the scripting environment.
e). The component and data patterns improve readability which helps to maintain larger apps.

//FIVE MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF REACT

a). It is easy to learn and use.
b). It enhances performance.
c). Here, creating dynamic web applications become easier.
d). Reuseable components.
e). It offers us the benefit of having a JavaScript library.

//THE SOFTWARE ENGINEER THAT CREATED REACT AND THE COMPANY THAT OWNS IT

Name:Jordan Walke
Company: Meta(formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

//3 NOTABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HTML AND JSX

a). In JSX, you must return a single parent element. HTML could harbour as many elements as possible.
b). HTML uses attributes, JSX uses props.
c). Camelcase is an important feature in JSX but not in HTML.

//WHY CAN'T BROWSERS READ JSX

JSX is not valid JavaScript so the browsers can't read it directly. They do not know what to do with it. So it 
needs a transpiler to translate it to React.
























































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
